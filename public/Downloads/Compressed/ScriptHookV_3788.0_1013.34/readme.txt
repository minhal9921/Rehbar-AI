							SCRIPT HOOK V	

v3788.0/1013.34
							
Description:
Script hook is the library that allows to use GTA V script native
functions in custom *.asi plugins.

You are allowed to use this software only if you agree to the terms
written below:
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR
THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE

Multiplayer:
Script hook closes the game when player goes Online, this is done because
the game reports installed mods list to R* while being in Online mode.

Installation:
1. Copy ScriptHookV.dll to the game's main folder, i.e. where GTA5.exe
   is located.
2. In order to load asi plugins you need to have asi loader installed,
   you can download it separately or use the latest version that comes
   with this distrib (dinput8.dll).
   You must delete old dsound.dll asiloader if you have one installed.
3. This distrib also includes a sample asi plugin - native trainer,
   if you need a trainer then copy NativeTrainer.asi as well.
4. See "how_to_install_2025.txt" for more information.
